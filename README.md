# AWS-DeepRacer-2023

As a freshman in the Data Science and Machine Learning program at Red River College Polytech, I developed a reward function that won first place in the first AWS DeepRacer competition held in Winnipeg in September 2023.

Using the AWS DeepRacer platform, my code utilized reinforcement learning techniques to train an autonomous racing model capable of navigating a physical race track with great precision and speed.

This achievement marks a significant milestone in my journey as a data scientist and demonstrates the potential of machine learning in autonomous vehicle technology.
